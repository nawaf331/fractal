1)What is a fractal?
** Mandelbrot:-
A rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts,
each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced/size copy of the whole.
** Mathematical:-
A set of points whose fractal dimension exceeds its topological dimension. 


2)How do i get these designs?
The Mandelbrot set is created by a general technique where a function of the form
z(n+1) = f(zn) is used to create a series of a complex variable.
In the case of the Mandelbrot the function is f(zn) = zn^2 + z0. 
*Mandelbrot^3 is f(zn)=zn^3+z0.
*Julia is f(zn)=zn^2+k; where k is any complex number
*star fractal is given by the equation f(z)=z^3+(-0.1+0.651i)
*flower fractal is z=z^2+C, where C varies per iteration of each point


3) I want to know some more!
The basic algorithm can be written as
for(y=0; y<Height; ++y)
{
    for(x=0; x<Width; ++x)
    {
  	// Calculate whether z0 belongs to the Mandelbrot set or
        // not and draw a pixel at coordinates (x,y) accordingly
    }
}


4) Cool, how did you come to know about this!!
It was thru one of my best friend. then i googled for more information.
Referred existing code, it helped me a lot while starting up this mini-project.


5)So what next?
Fractals are infinite in numbers. So this is a never ending project. 
Anybody who is interested to work on this, you're welcome. get the code from
